# Talk to Me

## Overview

It is a server-less Web application built using `AngularDart` and `WebRTC` where you can:

* Make a video call
* Create an agenda for the call
* Collaborate during the call

## Dart and AngularDart

`Dart` is a new platform for Web development that includes a language, tools, and libraries. `AngularDart` is a framework that enables building rich client-side applications. 

## Goal

The goal of this project is to be a sample application that can help you get started with `AngularDart`. I began working on it a few days ago to learn the framework. And since there is not much documentation about `AngularDart`, I decided to make it public, so others can benefit from it.
 
## AngularDart Tutorial Wiki

I found [AngularDart wiki](https://github.com/angular/angular.dart.tutorial/wiki) being extremely useful. Check it out.

## Work in Progress

The project is still very much a work in progress.
